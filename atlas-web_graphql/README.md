# Atlas Web GraphQL Project

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of GraphQL and its integration with various technologies such as MongoDB, Express, and React. The project involves setting up a GraphQL server, connecting it to a MongoDB database, and making queries from a React front-end using Apollo Client.

## Project Overview

### Learning Objectives

1. **Understand GraphQL**: Learn about GraphQL schemas, root queries, resolve functions, and type relations.
2. **GraphiQL**: Use GraphiQL for testing queries.
3. **Apollo**: Integrate Apollo Client in a React front-end for making queries and mutations.
4. **MongoDB**: Connect the GraphQL server to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
5. **Server Communication**: Make the GraphQL server accept requests from another server.

### Project Structure

1. **GraphQL Schema and Types**: Define the schema and types for your GraphQL API.
2. **Root Query and GraphiQL Testing**: Set up the root query and test it using GraphiQL.
3. **MongoDB and Mongoose Models**: Set up MongoDB and define models using Mongoose.
4. **Mutations**: Create and test mutations.
5. **Type Relations**: Implement relations between different types.
6. **React Front-end**: Set up a React front-end and integrate Apollo Client for making queries and mutations.
7. **Organize Queries**: Organize queries in separate files and compose them as needed.
8. **Task Details Queries**: Test task details queries in the front-end.
